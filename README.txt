//This API will simulate a playlist library API. In order to simulate a library this API will 
allow u to add the same song multiple times (not practical, but was
implemented to use more of the API). You will be able to see all of the songs within the playlist, as well as
checkout songs from the playlist and checkin songs to the playlist. Picture this API to be a simulation of a 
vinyl store. The gin web framework was used to make fast and efficient RESTFUL API calls such as 
GET, POST, and PATCH. Every RESTFUL call is called through a main function and is only called upon when that
path is prompted through the terminal. Next I hope to incorporate a frontend UI with REACT with the help of a
middleware such as AXIOS.
